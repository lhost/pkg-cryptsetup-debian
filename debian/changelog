  [ Steve Langasek ]
  * fix upstart jobs to not cause boot hangs when actually used in
    conjunction with startpar.  (closes: #694499, #677712).
  * in connection with the above, make the cryptdisks-early job explicitly

  * fix the shared library symbols magic: so far, the symbols file for
    libcryptsetup4 included just a wildcard for all exported symbols, with
    libcrypsetup4 (>= 2:1.4) as minimum version. This was wrong. Symbols
    that were added later need adjusted minimum versions. Thanks for the

    name for the source device that is not the kernel's preferred name for
    it (as is the case for LVs). (Thanks Steve Langasek)

  * check whether $NEWROOT already exists before actually invoking cryptsetup
    in initramfs cryptroot script. (closes: #653241)
  * fix conditions for prechecks at do_noluks() in cryptdisks.functions. Should

cryptsetup (2:1.1.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * new upstream release:
    - fix device alignment ioctl calls parameters for archs like ppc64.
    - fix activate_by_* API calls to handle NULL device name as documented
    - fix udev support for old libdevmapper with not compatible definition
  * fix rm_lo_setup() in cryptdisks.functions for failed device setup. thanks
    to Roger Pettersson. (closes: #581712)
  * add X-Stop-After headers to cryptdisks(-early) initscripts. this fixes
    shutdown process for system without encrypted rootfs at least. thanks to
    Alfredo Finelli. (closes: #575652)
  * more merges from ubuntu, thanks to and Steve Langasek (closes: #575024):
    - debian/cryptdisk.functions: initially create the device under a temporary
      name and rename it only at the end using 'dmsetup rename', to ensure that
      upstart/mountall doesn't see our device before it's ready to go.
      LP: #475936.
    - cryptdisks.functions: do_tmp should mount under /var/run/cryptsetup for
      changing the permissions of the filesystem root, not directly on /tmp,
      since mounting on /tmp a) is racy, b) confuses mountall something fierce.
      LP: #475936.
  * fix manpage checkscripts documentation. clarify that both cryptdisks and
    cryptroot invoke checkscripts. thanks Christoph Anton Mitterer.
  * remove quotes from $KEYSCRIPT invokation, thanks Alexandre Rossi.

  * improve documentation on environment variables in cryptdisks.default and
    crypttab manpage. thanks Christoph Anton Mitterer. (closes: #585664)
  * several improvements to (pre)check scripts, inspired by scripts from
    Christoph Anton Mitterer (closes: #585418, #585496)
    - checkscripts exit with error 1 if executables aren't available.
    - ext2, swap and xfs scripts are depreciated and invoke blkid script.
    - drop filtering of minix filesystem in blkid, util-linux 2.17.2 in debian
    - remove *vol_id check scripts, vol_id isn't available in debian any longer
    - don't use sed in *blkid check scripts any longer
  * fix initramfs/cryptroot-hook to canonicalize $device in get_resume_devices
    function. this should really weed out all duplicates. (closes: #586122),
    and catch all udev/device-mapper symlink setups as well (closes: #554506)
  * bash-completion file now in pck bash-completion (closes: #586299, #586162)
  * add a paragraph about the boot order of init scripts to README.Debian,
    describing the current catch-22 situation. (closes: #576646)
  * initscripts and cryptdisks_st* no longer silently quit in case that include
    file /lib/cryptsetup/cryptdisks.functions is missing. (closes: #587220)
  * fix cryptdisks-early LSB headers to restore legacy boot sequence order.
    mdadm-raid was started before cryptdisks-early. (closes: #587224)
  * cryptdisks initscript now raises a warning for failed started devices, and
    cryptdisks-early initscript raises a warning for failed stopped devices.
    this makes the initscript actions far more transparent to users. same holds
    for cryptdisks_st*. thanks to Christoph Anton Mitterer. (closes: #587222)
  * remove lintian overrides init.d-script-should-depend-on-virtual-facility
    as lintian lintian 2.4.2 has fixed #580082.
  * bump standards-version to 3.9.0, remove version information from replaces/
    provides/conflicts against cryptsetup-luks, change conflicts against
    hashalot (<= 0.3-1) to breaks hashalot (<< 0.3-1) and add replaces.
  * fix loads of typos, thanks to Christoph Anton Mitterer. (closes: #588068)
  * update copyright years and list Milan Broz in debian/copyright

    defaults changed to this temporary. it has been fixed in a subsequent
    upload of lvm2 in the meantime, but still it's not a bad idea to be

    upstream in another way. next cryptsetup release will print the command
    successfull message to stdout only if opt_verbose is set.
  * add checkscripts blkid and un_blkid for the reason that vol_id will be
    removed from udev soon. advertise the new scripts at all places that
    mentioned vol_id or un_vol_id before.

    than expected. (closes: #488271)
  * execute udev_settle before $cryptremove if $cryptcreate fails at
    setup_mapping() in the initramfs cryptroot script. it seems like a short

    - handle_crypttab_line_... || true needed due to set -e in initscript
    - check for exit code of handle_crypttab_line_{start<stop} in
      cryptdisks_{start|stop}, exit with proper status code (closes: #524173)
  * add a counter to the while loop in cryptdisks_{start|stop}, in order to
    detect if $dst was not found in crypttab. (closes: #524485)
  * check for keyscript in the new location in initramfs/cryptopensc-hook.
  * add README.opensc to docs, thanks to Benjamin Kiessling for writing it.
    (closes: #514538)
  * add patches/03_rework_read.patch [rework write_blockwise() and
    read_blockwise()], but don't apply it yet as it's still experimental.
    applying it will increase the speed of luksOpen.

  * Don't copy_exec libgcc1 in cryptopensc initramfs hook, as it's already
    copied by copy_exec /usr/sbin/pcscd automaticly. Thanks to Evgeni Golov
    <sargentd@die-welt.net>. (closes: #490300)
  * Remove the udev rules file again as the relevant rules are now provided
    by dmsetup package which cryptsetup depends on.
  * Add splashy support to askpass, thanks to John Hughes <john@calva.com>
    for the patch. (closes: #492451) The support is limited to cryptroot
    though, as splashy freezes for passphrase input dialogs from initscripts.
    Document that in README.Debian.
  * Now that askpass is used as keyscript for interactive mode, it's not
    necessary to set cryptsetup parameter '--tries=$TRIES' and TRIES=1 for
    interactive mode anymore in cryptdisks.functions.
  * Implement special treatment for random passphrases now that we use
    "--key-file=-" for all situations. Only necessary in do_noluks.
  * Fix the passphrase prompt string in initramfs/cryptroot.script to use
    $cryptsource instead of $cryptsources.
  * Major documentation cleanup for lenny:
    - Rewrite CryptoSwap.HowTo in README.Debian, remove CryptoSwap.HowTo.
    - Refer to README.initramfs instead of CryptoRoot.HowTo for encrypted root
      filesystem in README.Debian.
    - Remove outdated docs CryptoRoot.HowTo, usbcrypto.udev and gen-old-ssl-key
      as well as the decrypt_old_ssl keyscript.
    - Remove debian/TODO, didn't have any useful content anyway.
    - Fix section ''9. The "decrypt_derived" keyscript'': Add swap option to
      the example line for crypttab and other minor fixes. Thanks to
      Helmut Grohne <helmut@subdivi.de>. (closes: #491867)

    - Add support for debian build option parallel=n to debian/rules.
  * Add a udev rules file to ignore temporary-cryptsetup-* devices, as
    suggested in bug #467200. Thanks to Sam Morris <sam@robots.org.uk>.
  * Transform debian/copyright into machine-readable code as proposed in
    http://wiki.debian.org/Proposals/CopyrightFormat. Update and add several
    copyright notices.
  * Change reference to docbook xml v4.2 driver file from an online version

  * Change the initramfs script to use askpass to prompt for
    passphrases, this should hopefully fix #382375 and #465902 once it
    is enabled in the init scripts as well.
  * Add a keyscript called passdev which allows a keyfile to be
    retrieved from a device which is first mounted, mainly useful to get
    keyfiles off USB devices etc.
  * Unbreak MODULES=dep booting (closes: #478268)

    - [05_segfault_at_nonexisting_device.dpatch] likewise
    - [06_run_udevsettle.dpatch] update for new upstream
  * Disable 03_check_for_root.dpatch. As Ludwig Nussel mentioned on
    dm-crypt@saout.de, cryptsetup 1.0.5 already prints out meaningfull errors
    if expected permissions are not available. Therefore the check for uid ==
    0 is superfluous.

  * use 'check=un_vol_id, checkargs=swap' for swap devices per default.
  * added do_close function to cryptdisks.functions, as do_swap needs to use
    it. up to now, 'cryptsetup remove' was invoked regardless whether the
    device contains a LUKS partition or not. this is fixed now too.
  * allow custom check scripts. check only if $CHECK exists in

  * make precheck for no_luks mandatory, fail if any known filesystem is
    found.
  * update crypttab manpage to reflect the checksystem changes. added an own

    - moved option parsing and setup of loopback devices to seperate functions.
      added a new include file /lib/cryptsetup/init_functions with functions
      parse_opts, lo_setup, check_key, do_luks, do_noluks, do_swap, do_tmp
    - always check for the source device exists before running cryptsetup
    - hardcode precheck for LUKS to use 'cryptsetup isLuks'. this is much safer
      than allowing other random prechecks, as it manifests that the source
      device actually is a LUKS partition.
    - don't remove the LUKS device when postcheck fails, as the supplied
      password/key is correct anyway.
    - use the new 'timeout' commandline option of cryptsetup instead of an
      external wrapper
    - be silent for not existing devices per default. Implement the loud
      option for crypttab to warn if a device does not exist.
    - remerge postchecks and prechecks into checks.
    - don't disable swap & luks combination, instead disable luks with
      /dev/random, /dev/urandom or /dev/hwrandom as key.
    - run parse_opts before check_key, to know whether we use luks or not

  * adjust build environment to work with upstream sources, and without
    autogen.sh
  * merge fixes for debian scripts from cryptsetup.
  * keep cryptsetup manpage untouched, as merging cryptsetup and
    cryptsetup-luks manpages is rather complex.
  * set mandir to /usr/share/man for configure
  * add a lintian-override file
